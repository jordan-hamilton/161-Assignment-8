## Assignment 5 ##

**Project 8.a**

Write a void function named smallSort2 that takes as parameters the **addresses** of three int variables and sorts the ints at those addresses into ascending order. For example if the main method has:

    int first = 14;
    int second = -90;
    int third = 2;
    smallSort2(&first, &second, &third);
    cout << first << ", " << second << ", " << third << endl;

Then the output should be: `-90, 2, 14`

This can be very similar to your previous smallSort program, but uses pointers instead of references.

The file must be named **smallSort2.cpp**.

**Project 8.b**

Write a **void** function called transformArray that takes two parameters - a reference to a pointer to a **dynamically allocated** array of ints, and the size of that array. The pointer is passed by reference because you want to change the value of the pointer. The function should **replace** the array with one that is twice as long, with the values from the original array followed by each of those values plus one.  For example, if array that was passed in was {4, 2, 5}, then it should be replaced by {4, 2, 5, 5, 3, 6}. **The function should prevent any memory leaks**. Remember to also prevent memory leaks in the main you use for testing.

For example, it could be used like this:

    int* myArray = new int[3];
    myArray[0] = 4;
    myArray[1] = 2;
    myArray[2] = 5;

    transformArray(myArray, 3);

    for (int i=0; i<6; i++)
      cout << myArray[i] << endl;

    delete []myArray;

The file must be named **transformArray.cpp**.
